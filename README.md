--Library Management System--
This is a library management system project developed as an individual project during my first year in my diploma program. The project is aimed at efficiently managing library resources and operations.


--Project Overview--
The library management system includes the following features:

User Management: Allows librarians to add, update, and delete user information.
Book Management: Enables librarians to manage books, including adding new books, updating existing ones, and removing books from the library inventory.
Borrowing and Returning Books: Provides functionality for users to borrow books and return them within the specified due date.
Search and Filter: Users can search for books based on title, author, category, etc.
Reports: Generates reports on books borrowed, overdue books, and other statistics.


--Folder Structure--
As only the Java files are included, the folder structure primarily consists of source code files:

/src: Contains the Java source code files for the library management system. Note: Due to file limitations, non-Java files such as images and additional resources are not included in this repository.
